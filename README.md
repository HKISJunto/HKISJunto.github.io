# Letter From the Former Editor-in-Chief
To Whomever it may concern,

After our new Editorial Board appointments, the subsequent loss of our old website, general restructuring, and some understated amount of frustration, I made the decision to scrap what we had originally planned for the Junto website in an effort to get something back on our page as quickly as possible.

This Jekyll-built website is a temporary solution.
I would hope that a long term solution will include a separate database from which to pull articles (and to archive them), a way to track article performance, and be built in such a way as to allow future developers on the Junto team the ability to easily add new tools and features to it. I would hope that the long term solution is not Jekyll as well, but that's up to the next developer.

Right, so: Today is July 4, 2017.

As the former Editor-in-Chief, this will be the last thing I do for the team. After this week, I will no longer be available to "fix" or deliver solutions on this front nor do I assume that as my responsibility.

On July 12, all responsibility for this website, its contents, its development and maintenance (including but not limited to its hosting on the web), will be that of HKIS Junto.

Good luck,

Amanda Liang '17
